								<p>In this work, we put forth a philosophical treatise on a novel paradigm for an intangible, on-demand, and power-free aerial communication relaying, for which
									we coin the term “Phantom Networks”. The proposed Phantom Network aims to temporarily bridge communication gaps between two or more out-of-range communicating devices or infrastructures using aerial nanonodes
									suspended in atomized aqueous mists. This proposed on-demand shoot-and-scoot communication enabler is of particular interest to scenarios where there is a need for rapid deployment of temporary communication or
									relaying infrastructures for enabling higher data volume communication networks, primarily associated with military operations. As the conceptualized aerial network is primarily aqueous, its coverage and lifetime are highly
									dependent on ensuing atmospheric conditions in the deployment area. The possible future use of this proposed paradigm includes establishing temporary infrastructure free networks during disaster management and battlefield
									communications. We discuss the design and implementation challenges posed by the intended on-demand aerial nano-network based communication relaying paradigm, its application horizon, and scope for future works.</p>

							<p>This work looks into the problem of a decentralized data offloading within an edge UAV swarm to mitigate the complexities of
								a single UAV continually generating and processing large application specific data. The mobile edge UAVs considered here are multi-rotor
								types having constrained energy and processing power, which makes long-term handling of large data volumes impossible for standalone
								UAVs. The load mitigation is carried out by offloading data from a source UAV to other swarm members with sufficient energy and processing
								requirements. In this work, we focus on selecting the most optimal multi-hop path through the UAVs concerning available energies and
								processing resources, which can survive the duration of the data offload between the source and a target UAV. We formulate a Multi-Armed
								Bandit (MAB) based offload path selection scheme, which selects the most energy and processing optimized multi-hop path between a source
								and a target UAV. Upon comparison of our scheme against the naive shortest path approach, we observe that our approach results in significant
								savings of collective network energies, even for long operational durations.</p>

							<p>In this paper, we propose the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based server-side sequence prediction
							algorithm to ease network data-load caused by rapid polling of multiple sensors onboard aerial robotic platforms, which are wirelessly tethered to a remote server for control and
							coordination. Our scheme reduces the network access time latencies between these platforms and the remote server hosting the control and scheduling mechanisms. Reduction
							in the TDMA-based access time is achieved by reducing the actual amount of data transmitted over the network, using partial transmission of actual sensor data over the network
							and server-side sequence prediction of the voluntarily missed sensor values. Our scheme allows the TDMA control of an increased number of networked platforms without change
							of infrastructure or the network characteristics.</p>

							<p>This work addresses the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
								(UAV) swarm deployment -- some fitted with multimedia sensors, while others armed with scalar sensors -- in resource-constrained and challenging environments, typically associated with farming.
								Subsequently, we also address the resulting problem of sensing and processing resource-intensive data aerially within the Edge swarm in the fastest and most efficient manner possible. The heterogeneous
								nature of the Edge swarm results in under-utilization of the available computation resources due to unequal data generation within its members. To address this, we propose a Nash bargaining-
								based weighted intra-Edge processing offload scheme to mitigate the problem of heavy processing in some of the swarm members. We do this by distributing the data to be processed to all the swarm
								members. Real-life hardware tuned simulation of a large UAV swarm shows that by increasing the number of UAVs in the swarm, our scheme achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays
								for intensive processing tasks. Additionally, in comparison to regular star and mesh topologies, our scheme achieves an increase in collective available network processing speeds by 100% for only 25%
								of the number of UAVs in a star topology.</p>

							<p>The gain in popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), platforms and systems (UAS) can be
								attributed to its ease of operation, versatility and risk-free piloting. The primary UAV application domain has expanded, from recreational and military 
								ights, to include scientific surveys and agriculture. The popularity of UAVs in scientific data gathering and applications, especially the
								use of small, multi-rotor UAVs is quite widespread. These multi-rotor UAVs are small, portable, low-cost, highly manoeuvrable, and easy to handle. These features make such UAVs attractive to
								scientists and researchers worldwide. There has been a sudden spurt of UAV use in niche domains, such as agriculture. Agriculturalists are choosing UAV-based field operations and remote sensing
								over the time-tested satellite-based ones, especially for local-scale and high spatiotemporal resolution imagery. In this survey, we explore various UAV application areas, types, sensors, research domains,
								deployment architectures. Comparisons between various UAV types, sensing technologies (UAV, WSN, satellites), UAV architectures and their utility in precision agriculture has been provided.
								Additionally, crop stress, its types, and detection using various remotely-sensed vegetation indices have been explored for their use in UAV-based remote sensing.</p>

									<h2>UAV Controls</h2>
									<span class="byline">Fog-Based Visual Gesture Control and External Stabilization for Micro-UAVs</span>
								</header>
								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/gesture.png" style="width:70%;" align="center" alt=""></a></p>
								<p>We propose a method for a single ground
									camera-based visual gesture control of a quadrotor mUAV
									platform, making its flight more responsive and adaptive
									to its human controller as compared to a human
									controller using keypads or joysticks for controls. The
									proposed camera-based gesture control scheme provides
									an average accuracy of 100% gestures detected, as compared
									to accuracies obtained using expensive Kinectbased
									hardware, or processing intensive CNN-based pose
									estimation techniques with 97.5% and 83.3% average
									accuracies, respectively. A fog-based stabilization mechanism
									is additionally employed, which allows for flight-time
									stabilization of the mUAV, even in the presence
									of unbalanced payloads or unbalancing of the mUAV
									due to minor structural damages. This allows the use
									of the same mUAV without the need for frequent weight
									readjustments or mUAV calibration. This approach has
									been tested in real-time, both indoors as well as outdoors.</p>

									<h2>Opportunistic UAV Networks</h2>
									<span class="byline">Random Opportunistic and Selective Exploration for Cooperative Edge Swarm of UAVs</span>
								</header>
								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/rose.png" style="width:70%;" align="center" alt=""></a></p>
								<p>In this work, we propose a physical approximation
								scheme – Random Opportunistic and Selective Exploration
								(ROSE) – for aerial localization of survivors by using a collaborative
								swarm of IoT-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
								The UAV swarm performs a simultaneous multi-pronged search
								of a given zone by dividing the search region among the swarm
								members. This multi-pronged search strategy speeds-up the
								search, and the division of search areas among the swarm
								members avoids redundant exploration of an already explored
								location. As the communication range of the member UAVs
								is limited, the swarm members communicate opportunistically
								among themselves to share the information of the visited
								sites. We formulate the various probabilities associated with
								opportunistic communication of these aerial IoT nodes and
								simulate the performance of the approximation algorithm based
								on these formulations. Simulation results of the proposed approach
								successfully locate 100% of the ground targets within an
								acceptable time-frame, and out-performs established searching
								schemes such as the truncated Levy walk, frontier-based search,
								and sweep search.</p>
