									<h2>Interoperability in IoT Healthcare Devices</h2>

									<span class="label info">IEEE INFOCOM 2020</span>

								<p>In this work, we propose Over-The-Air (OTA)-
									based reconfigurable IoT health-monitoring wearables, which
									tether wirelessly to a low-power and portable central processing
									and communication hub (CPH). This hub is responsible for
									the proper packetization and transmission of the physiological
									data received from the individual sensors connected to each
									wearable to a remote server. Each wearable consists of a sensor, a
									communication adapter, and its power module.We introduce lowpower
									adapters with each sensor, which facilitates the sensor-CPH
									linkups and on-demand network parameter reconfigurations.
									The newly introduced adapter supports the interoperability of
									heterogeneous sensors by eradicating the need for sensor-specific
									modules through OTA-based reconfiguration. The reconfiguration
									feature allows for new sensors to connect to an existing adapter,
									without changing the hardware units or any external interface.
									The proposed system is scalable and enables multiple sensors
									to connect in a network and work in synchronization with the
									CPH to achieve semantic and device interoperability among the
									sensors. We test the implementation in real-time using three
									different health-monitoring sensor types – temperature, pulse
									oximeter, and ECG. The results of our real-time system evaluation
									depict that the proposed system is reliable and responsive in terms
									of the achieved packet delivery ratio, received signal strength, and
									energy consumption</p>

									<h2>Energy-aware IoT Wearable</h2>
									<span class="byline"> DROPS: Dynamic Radio Protocol Selection for Energy-Constrained Wearable IoT Healthcare</span>
									<span class="label info">IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communication</span>
								</header>
								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/drops.PNG" style="width:50%;" align="center" alt=""></a></p>
								<p>We propose “DROPS”, a scheme which dynamically
									selects radio protocols in an energy-constrained wearable
									IoT healthcare system. We consider the use of multiple radio
									protocols, which are capable of transmitting a patient’s sensed
									physiological parameters to the server through Local Processing
									Units (LPUs). As the health parameters are non-stationary
									and temporally fluctuating, especially for critical patients, the
									selection of an appropriate radio protocol is essential to maintain
									the accuracy and timely delivery of data from the patient
									to the server. Additionally, the mobility of patients through
									various locations within the hospital mandates the selection of the
									best radio protocol among the multiple available ones for each
									location, to enable data to offload to the remote server. We use
									single-leader-multiple-follower Stackelberg non-cooperative game
									to map the strategic interactions between a patient’s LPU and the
									hospital’s server. “DROPS” dynamically selects the appropriate
									radio protocol, based on the criticality index of a patient, the
									reputation of the radio, the Euclidean distance between the
									radios and the LPU, and the load on the protocol. Results on
									real-life data and their large-scale emulation show that the data
									rate increases by almost 78% and throughput by approximately
									7%, as compared to existing schemes.</p>

									<h2>Network Traffic-aware IoT Healthcare</h2>
									<span class="byline"> SkopEdge: A Traffic-Aware Edge-Based Remote Auscultation Monitor</span>
									<span class="label info">IEEE ICC 2020</span>
								</header>
								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/skop1.PNG" style="width:50%;" align="center" alt=""></a></p>
								<p>In this paper, we develop and analyze a smart
								digital stethoscope – SkopEdge – to provide reliable remote
								e-health monitoring with a minimum delay while enhancing
								overall network performance. SkopEdge initially records the
								heart sounds from individuals and then senses the quality of the
								network. Depending on the network traffic, SkopEdge converts
								the audio clip into an appropriate format before transferring
								it to remote locations for estimating the number of heartbeats
								and storage. Towards this, we formulate the link quality along
								with SkopEdge’s current configuration as a Markov Decision
								Process (MDP) with actions as conversion format selection.
								The remote server then returns the result, which SkopEdge
								displays on its screen. Real-time implementations show that
								SkopEdge works efficiently in all network conditions. Further,
								audio conversions usually degrade the quality of sound, but
								our proposed system does not change its primary components.
								Although SkopEdge exhibits an increase in energy consumption
								by 79% while converting to lower-quality formats, it also reduces
								the energy consumption by 99% while transmitting the same,
								which subsequently results in energy savings. Further, we provide
								an analysis of the estimated heartbeats in an audio clip by
								SkopEdge.</p>

									<h2>IoT-enabled Ambient Assisted Living</h2>
									<span class="byline"> MiND: Mind Networked Device Architecture for Attention-Gated Ambient Assisted Living Systems</span>
									<span class="label info">IEEE Systems Journal</span>
								</header>
								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/aal1.PNG" style="width:50%;" align="center" alt=""></a></p>
								<p>This paper proposes and evaluates an online architecture
									for networked Brain-Computer Interfaced (BCI) smart
									home systems for enabling Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Our
									work uses multiple portable, low cost, single channel EEG (Electroencephalograph)
									systems to achieve mind networked devices
									(MiND) for home appliance control aiming to enable better
									accessibility for the infirm and people with mobility disability. We
									tested our approach on real-life hardware towards the control of
									devices such as lights, fans, and room temperature conditioning
									systems and emulated the behavior of the networked hardware
									for a more substantial number of users on conceptualized scenarios,
									which will be encountered in implementing this architecture.
									The NS2 simulation results of the large-scale implementation
									show promising results and give a precise idea about various
									essential features such as routing protocols, routing configuration,
									mode of transmission, attenuation losses, and delays incurred
									during in-house operation of this architecture.</p>
