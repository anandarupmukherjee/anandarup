									<h2>Reinforcement Learning based Offloading in Fog IoT</h2>
									<span class="byline"> Multi-Armed Bandit-based Decentralized Computation Offloading in Fog-Enabled IoT</span>

								</header>

								<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) environments have hard realtime
									tasks that need execution within fixed deadlines. As IoT devices
									consist of a myriad of sensors, each task is composed of multiple
									interdependent subtasks. Towards this, the cloud and fog computing
									platforms have the potential of facilitating these IoT Sensor Nodes (SNs)
									in accommodating complex operations with minimum delay. To further
									reduce operational latencies, we breakdown the high-level tasks into
									smaller subtasks and form a Directed Acyclic Task Graph (DATG). Initially,
									the SNs offload their tasks to a nearby Fog Node (FN) based on a
									greedy choice. The greedy formulation helps in selecting the FN in linear
									time while avoiding combinatorial optimizations at the SN, which saves
									time as well as energy. IoT environments are highly dynamic, which
									mandates the need for adaptive solutions. At the chosen FN, depending
									on the dependencies on the DATGs, its corresponding deadlines, and
									the varying conditions of the other FNs, we propose an epsilon-greedy nonstationary
									multiarmed bandit-based scheme (D2CIT) for online task allocation
									among them. The online learning D2CIT scheme allows the FN
									to autonomously select a set of FNs for distributing the subtasks among
									themselves and executes the subtasks in parallel with minimum latency,
									energy, and resource usage. Simulation results show that D2CIT offers
									a reduction in latency by 17% compared to traditional fog computing
									schemes. Additionally, upon comparison with existing online learningbased
									task offloading solutions in fog environments, D2CIT offers an
									improved speedup of 59% due to the induced parallelism.</p>

									<h2>Machine Learning for Agricultural IoT</h2>
									<span class="byline"> Blind Entity Identification for Agricultural IoT Deployments</span>

								<p>Integration of various technologies to an Internet of
									Things (IoT) framework share the common goals of a consistent
									and structured data format that can be applied to any device,
									given the vast application scope of IoT. Additional goals include
									minimizing channel traffic and system energy consumption. In
									this work, we propose to dismiss the requirement of certain
									seemingly crucial identifier fields from packets arriving through
									various sensor nodes in an agricultural IoT deployment. The
									proposed approach reduces packet size, thereby reducing channel
									traffic and energy consumption, as well as retaining the capability
									of identifying these originating nodes. We propose a method of a
									blind agricultural IoT node and sensor identification, which can
									be sourced and operated from a master node as well as a remote
									server. Additionally, this scheme has the capability of detecting
									the radio link quality between the master and slave nodes in a
									rudimentary form, as well as identifying the sensor nodes. We
									successfully trained and tested various multi-layer perceptron
									(MLP)-based models for blind identification, in real-time, using
									our implemented agricultural IoT implementation. The effect
									of changes in learning rate and momentum of the optimizer
									on the accuracy of classification is also studied. The projected
									cumulative energy savings across the network architecture, of
									our scheme, in conjunction with TCP/IP header compression
									techniques, are substantial. For a 100 node deployment using
									a combination of the proposed blind identification reduced
									sampling strategies over regular IPv4-based TCP/IP connection,
									an estimated annual saving of 99% is projected.</p>

									<h2>Edge processing for Agricultural IoT</h2>

									<span class="label info">IEEE Globecomm Workshop 2018</span>

								<p>Dense IoT implementations incur heavy data load on
									the implemented networks. In this paper, we propose and evaluate
									a low-latency method of increasing the packet throughput in agricultural
									IoT implementations. The proposed method envisions
									removal of node identifiers from packets before transmission
									and predictive packet-source mapping method within the edge
									layer of an agrarian Internet of Things (IoT) implementation.
									The edge layer following a master-slave architecture. Pre-trained
									lightweight machine learning models at the edge identify the
									origin of the incoming packets based on the long-term learned
									collective variations of the sensorial values from the slave node.
									This reduction in packets significantly frees up time-slots at
									the receiving master node, allowing for more simultaneous
									connections to it. This intra-edge packet origin mapping scheme is
									further compared with the approach of edge node identification
									at a remote server to adjudge the tradeoffs between accuracy
									and latency of transmission. The proposed method doubles the
									amount of sensor data transmitted between the slave to master
									nodes with significant energy savings over longer duration and increases
									the data throughput by approximately 1:5 times between
									the master node and the remote server for our implementation.
									The proposed method estimates energy savings in the order
									of 20 watts for a deployment setup of 100 nodes over a year.
									The energy savings over densely deployed IoT networks can be
									utilized to accommodate more nodes and increase the lifetime of
									the network.</p>

								<p>The utility of knowledge discovery on the Internet of Things
									(IoT) and its allied domains is undeniably one of the most
									indispensable ones, which results in optimized placement
									architectures, efficient routing protocols, device energy savings,
									and enhanced security measures for the implementation.
									The absence of knowledge discovery in IoT results
									in just an implementation of large-scale sensor networks,
									which generates a huge amount of data, and which needs, an
									often under-optimized, processing for actionable outputs. In
									this survey, we explore the various domains of IoT for which
									knowledge discovery is inseparable from the application,
									and how it benefits the overall implementation of the IoT
									architecture.</p>

									<h2>Smartphone-based Activity Recognition</h2>

								<p>In this paper we propose SmartARM – a
								Smartphone-based group Activity Recognition and Monitoring
								(ARM) scheme, which is capable of recognizing and
								centrally monitoring coordinated group and individual group
								member activities of soldiers in the context of military
								excercises. In this implementation, we specifically consider
								military operations, where the group members perform similar
								motions or manoeuvres on a mission. Additionally, remote
								administrators at the command center receive data from the
								smartphones on a central server, enabling them to visualize
								and monitor the overall status of soldiers in situations such
								as battlefields, urban operations and during soldier’s physical
								training. This work establishes – (a) the optimum position of
								smartphone placement on a soldier, (b) the optimum classifier
								to use from a given set of options, and (c) the minimum
								sensors or sensor combinations to use for reliable detection
								of physical activities, while reducing the data-load on the
								network. The activity recognition modules using the selected
								classifiers are trained on available data-sets using a testtrain-
								validation split approach. The trained models are used
								for recognizing activities from live smartphone data. The
								proposed activity detection method puts forth an accuracy
								of 80% for real-time data.</p>

								<p>The use of rovers in navigating dangerous and uncharted
									terrains for localization, mapping and data-gathering
									for search and rescue in disaster management is a challenging
									domain, especially with constrained network connectivity. In
									this paper, a rover mounted rotating turret-based 2D ultrasonic
									distance mapping and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based
									dead-reckoning (R2D2) mechanism is proposed. The wireless
									rover is operated over a constrained network, allowing its
									handler to gather situational awareness of a hazardous site
									remotely, and without risking lives. A visualization of the
									path of this rover by means of a low data intensity fusion
									map generated using a combination of ultrasonic distance
									measurements and relative positioning information from the
									dead-reckoning system is performed by the remote operator</p>
