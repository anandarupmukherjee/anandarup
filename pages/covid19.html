									<h2>Phantom Networks</h2>
									<span class="byline">The Intangible Shoot-and-Scoot Communication Paradigm For Future Militaries</span>

								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/phantom.png" style="width:70%;" align="center" alt=""></a></p>
								<p>In this work, we put forth a philosophical treatise on a novel paradigm for an intangible, on-demand, and power-free aerial communication relaying, for which
									we coin the term “Phantom Networks”. The proposed Phantom Network aims to temporarily bridge communication gaps between two or more out-of-range communicating devices or infrastructures using aerial nanonodes
									suspended in atomized aqueous mists. This proposed on-demand shoot-and-scoot communication enabler is of particular interest to scenarios where there is a need for rapid deployment of temporary communication or
									relaying infrastructures for enabling higher data volume communication networks, primarily associated with military operations. As the conceptualized aerial network is primarily aqueous, its coverage and lifetime are highly
									dependent on ensuing atmospheric conditions in the deployment area. The possible future use of this proposed paradigm includes establishing temporary infrastructure free networks during disaster management and battlefield
									communications. We discuss the design and implementation challenges posed by the intended on-demand aerial nano-network based communication relaying paradigm, its application horizon, and scope for future works.</p>

					<h2>Navigation through COVID-19 Hotspots</h3>

							<p>In this paper, we present a Q-learning-enabled safe navigation
								system – S-Nav – that recommends routes in a road network
								by minimizing traveling through categorically demarcated COVID-19
								hotspots. S-Nav takes the source and destination as inputs from the
								commuters and recommends a safe path for traveling. The S-Nav system
								dodges hotspots and ensures minimal passage through them in
								unavoidable situations. This feature of S-Nav reduces the commuter’s
								risk of getting exposed to these contaminated zones and contracting
								the virus. To achieve this, we formulate the reward function for the
								reinforcement learning model by imposing zone-based penalties and
								demonstrate that S-Nav achieves convergence under all conditions. To
								ensure real-time results, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based
								architecture by incorporating the cloud and fog computing paradigms.
								While the cloud is responsible for training on large road networks,
								the geographically-aware fog nodes take the results from the cloud
								and retrain them based on smaller road networks. Through extensive
								implementation and experiments, we observe that S-Nav recommends
								reliable paths in near real-time. In contrast to state-of-the-art techniques,
								S-Nav limits passage through red/orange zones to almost 2% and close
								to 100% through green zones. However, we observe 18% additional
								travel distances compared to precarious shortest paths.</p>

							<p>In this chapter, we propose COVI-SCANNER, an IoT-based solution to overcome the issue of
							secondary spread of the virus from fomite spaces in public infrastructures. With the assumption
							that the infected individuals are already identified, we design COVI-SCANNER as two
							augmented reality-based phases: contamination and sanitization. In the contamination phase, we
							first detect the person and the corresponding bounding boxes for tracking his/her movements and
							highlight the spaces as they contaminate it. In the sanitization phase, we first identify
							cleaning/sanitization materials/objects and remove the markers as they pass (while cleaning)
							through the highlighted fomite spaces to ensure sanitization. Additionally, we minimize the delay
							by dividing the resource-constrained fog nodes into two dedicated sets for performing each phase
							before transferring to centralized servers for storage, which also reduces bottlenecks at the
							server. Through the extensive implementation of COVI-SCANNER, we observe that it operates
							with 81% accuracy on real-time data with a delay of at most 0.1 and 1.2 seconds for the
							contamination and sanitization phases, respectively. Further, due to the incorporation of the IoT-
							based architecture, we observe maximum upload and download rates of 700 Kbps in each phase.</p>
