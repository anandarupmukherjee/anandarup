									<h2>Resource-Constrained SDN Blockchain for IoT</h2>

								<p>Software-Defined Network (SDN) is vital in simplifying
									the dynamic network characteristics and device management.
									However, the centralized architecture of SDN opens the scope for
									malicious attacks on the controllers. To mitigate such attacks
									in real-time, we propose an SDN architecture for resourceconstrained
									devices in a fog-enabled IoT environment using a
									private blockchain (pBC) network. We exploit the decentralized
									nature of pBC for enabling resource-constrained SDN controllers
									towards transparently setting flow rules for fog nodes and other
									devices in the network. In case the miners identify faulty flow
									rules, pBC allows the SDN devices/fog nodes to retract back
									to an earlier flow rule while raising a flag against the alleged
									controller. Additionally, since data in pBC are accessible by all the
									candidates having the same genesis file, they are readily available
									to malicious users. Towards this, we further propose encrypting
									the data before inserting them into the blocks, which helps in
									securing the data from undesired users. Through the extensive
									deployment of our proposed fusion, we observe CPU usage of
									30% among the devices and latencies in the range of milliseconds,
									which presents the feasibility of our system with minimum delay.
									We also observe a reduction in energy consumption by more than
									90%, compared to traditional SDN.</p>

									<h2>Performance Evaluation of Edge Blockchain in IoT</h2>
									<span class="byline"> Blockchain at the Edge: Performance of Resource-Constrained IoT Networks</span>
									<span class="label info">IEEE Trans. on Parallel and Distributed Systems</span>

								<p>The proliferation of IoT in various technological
									realms has resulted in the massive spurt of unsecured data. The
									use of complex security mechanisms for securing these data is
									highly restricted owing to the low-power and low-resource nature
									of most of the IoT devices, especially at the Edge. In this work,
									we propose to use blockchains for extending security to such
									IoT implementations. We deploy a private Ethereum blockchain
									consisting of both regular and constrained devices connecting
									to the blockchain through wired and wireless heterogeneous
									networks. We additionally implement a secure and encrypted
									networked clock mechanism to synchronize the non-real-time
									IoT Edge nodes within the blockchain. Further, we experimentally
									study the feasibility of such a deployment and the bottlenecks
									associated with it.We study the effects of network latency,
									increase in constrained blockchain nodes, data size, Ether, and
									blockchain node mobility during transaction and mining of data
									within our deployed blockchain. This study serves as a guideline
									for designing secured solutions for IoT implementations under
									various operating conditions such as those encountered for
									static IoT nodes and mobile IoT devices.</p>

									<p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are coming up as
										a powerful tool in various industrial applications in the context
										of enabling Industrial IoT. The limited power source and flight
										time of UAVs along with the need for skilled UAV operators are
										some of the most daunting challenges to the integration of UAVs
										in industrial applications such as site inspection, workforce monitoring,
										logistics, and others. In this paper, we propose the unique
										paradigm of blockchain-enabled UAV virtualization to provide
										virtual UAV-as-a-service for industrial applications. The proposed
										architecture also aims at providing secure and persistent UAV
										services to the end-users along with a partially decentralized
										blockchain model to ensure security, privacy, service quality, and
										transparency. UAV virtualization allows persistent UAV services,
										globally, without procuring any physical UAVs. The platform
										offers virtual UAV services on a pay per use basis to the enduser.
										The UAV owners and virtual UAV service providers gain
										monetary benefits for their contribution to the UAV services.
										Finally, we discuss the implications of the proposed platform on
										the domains of Industrial IoT and the possible challenges in the
										implementation of this paradigm.</p>
