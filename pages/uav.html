									<h2>Phantom Networks</h2>

								<p>In this work, we put forth a philosophical treatise on a novel paradigm for an intangible, on-demand, and power-free aerial communication relaying, for which
									we coin the term “Phantom Networks”. The proposed Phantom Network aims to temporarily bridge communication gaps between two or more out-of-range communicating devices or infrastructures using aerial nanonodes
									suspended in atomized aqueous mists. This proposed on-demand shoot-and-scoot communication enabler is of particular interest to scenarios where there is a need for rapid deployment of temporary communication or
									relaying infrastructures for enabling higher data volume communication networks, primarily associated with military operations. As the conceptualized aerial network is primarily aqueous, its coverage and lifetime are highly
									dependent on ensuing atmospheric conditions in the deployment area. The possible future use of this proposed paradigm includes establishing temporary infrastructure free networks during disaster management and battlefield
									communications. We discuss the design and implementation challenges posed by the intended on-demand aerial nano-network based communication relaying paradigm, its application horizon, and scope for future works.</p>

							<p>This work looks into the problem of a decentralized data offloading within an edge UAV swarm to mitigate the complexities of
								a single UAV continually generating and processing large application specific data. The mobile edge UAVs considered here are multi-rotor
								types having constrained energy and processing power, which makes long-term handling of large data volumes impossible for standalone
								UAVs. The load mitigation is carried out by offloading data from a source UAV to other swarm members with sufficient energy and processing
								requirements. In this work, we focus on selecting the most optimal multi-hop path through the UAVs concerning available energies and
								processing resources, which can survive the duration of the data offload between the source and a target UAV. We formulate a Multi-Armed
								Bandit (MAB) based offload path selection scheme, which selects the most energy and processing optimized multi-hop path between a source
								and a target UAV. Upon comparison of our scheme against the naive shortest path approach, we observe that our approach results in significant
								savings of collective network energies, even for long operational durations.</p>

							<p>In this paper, we propose the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based server-side sequence prediction
							algorithm to ease network data-load caused by rapid polling of multiple sensors onboard aerial robotic platforms, which are wirelessly tethered to a remote server for control and
							coordination. Our scheme reduces the network access time latencies between these platforms and the remote server hosting the control and scheduling mechanisms. Reduction
							in the TDMA-based access time is achieved by reducing the actual amount of data transmitted over the network, using partial transmission of actual sensor data over the network
							and server-side sequence prediction of the voluntarily missed sensor values. Our scheme allows the TDMA control of an increased number of networked platforms without change
							of infrastructure or the network characteristics.</p>

							<p>This work addresses the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
								(UAV) swarm deployment -- some fitted with multimedia sensors, while others armed with scalar sensors -- in resource-constrained and challenging environments, typically associated with farming.
								Subsequently, we also address the resulting problem of sensing and processing resource-intensive data aerially within the Edge swarm in the fastest and most efficient manner possible. The heterogeneous
								nature of the Edge swarm results in under-utilization of the available computation resources due to unequal data generation within its members. To address this, we propose a Nash bargaining-
								based weighted intra-Edge processing offload scheme to mitigate the problem of heavy processing in some of the swarm members. We do this by distributing the data to be processed to all the swarm
								members. Real-life hardware tuned simulation of a large UAV swarm shows that by increasing the number of UAVs in the swarm, our scheme achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays
								for intensive processing tasks. Additionally, in comparison to regular star and mesh topologies, our scheme achieves an increase in collective available network processing speeds by 100% for only 25%
								of the number of UAVs in a star topology.</p>

							<p>In this work, we propose an Energy-aware Collaborative
								Routing (ECoR) scheme for optimally handling task offloading between
								source and destination UAVs in a grid-locked UAV swarm. We divide the
								proposed scheme into two parts – routing path discovery and routing
								path selection. The scheme selects the most optimal path between a
								source and destination from a massive set of all possible paths, based
								on the maximization of residual energy of UAVs along a selected path.
								This routing path selection ensures balanced energy utilization between
								members of the UAV swarm and enhances the overall path lifetime
								without incurring additional delays in doing so. Actual readings from
								our small-scale UAV swarm testbed are utilized to emulate a largescale
								scenario and analyze the behavior of our proposed scheme. Upon
								comparison of the ECoR scheme with broadcast-based routing and the
								shortest path based routing, we observe better sustainability regarding
								the longevity of the UAV lifetimes in the swarm, optimized individual UAV,
								as well as reduced collective path-based energy consumption, all the
								while having comparable transmission delays to the shortest path based
								scheme.</p>

							<p>In this paper, we propose an architecture for UAV
								virtualization with the primary aim to provide virtualized UAV
								services to multiple users by envisioning the concept of UAV-asa-
								Service. In contrast to traditional UAVs, which are resourceconstraint
								in nature and exhibit shorter flight times, our proposed
								UAV virtualization overcomes the limitations of short flight time
								of traditional UAVs, in turn allowing them to provide persistent
								and ubiquitous services. We achieve the virtualization of a UAV
								through multiple collaborating real-life UAVs performing various
								tasks in tandem. In this work, we focus on the placement and selection
								of UAVs to achieve virtualization. We use a social welfarebased
								approach to select suitable UAVs, from the available ones,
								and map the UAV to a virtual one. This work enables the
								provision of different UAV services to multiple end-users, without
								actual procurement of the UAVs by the end-users. We compare
								the results for optimal placement, normal maximum energybased
								UAV selection, and Atkinson-based selection method. We
								also compare the virtual model and simple UAV-to-task model to
								physical UAV usage, task completion ratio, and residual energy
								of the system. Our proposed model outperforms the traditional
								model with a task completion efficiency of 94.26%. The residual
								energy of the system also increases with an increase in the number
								of tasks.</p>

							<p>The gain in popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), platforms and systems (UAS) can be
								attributed to its ease of operation, versatility and risk-free piloting. The primary UAV application domain has expanded, from recreational and military 
								ights, to include scientific surveys and agriculture. The popularity of UAVs in scientific data gathering and applications, especially the
								use of small, multi-rotor UAVs is quite widespread. These multi-rotor UAVs are small, portable, low-cost, highly manoeuvrable, and easy to handle. These features make such UAVs attractive to
								scientists and researchers worldwide. There has been a sudden spurt of UAV use in niche domains, such as agriculture. Agriculturalists are choosing UAV-based field operations and remote sensing
								over the time-tested satellite-based ones, especially for local-scale and high spatiotemporal resolution imagery. In this survey, we explore various UAV application areas, types, sensors, research domains,
								deployment architectures. Comparisons between various UAV types, sensing technologies (UAV, WSN, satellites), UAV architectures and their utility in precision agriculture has been provided.
								Additionally, crop stress, its types, and detection using various remotely-sensed vegetation indices have been explored for their use in UAV-based remote sensing.</p>

							<p>In this work, we propose an autonomous and on-board image-based agricultural land demarcation and path-planning system - IDeAL
							(IoT-Based Autonomous Aerial Demarcation and Path-planning for Traversing Agricultural Lands) - using our advanced UAV-based
							aerial IoT platform. Our work successfully addresses the problem of onboard and autonomous path-planning - which conventional

							Our aerial system visually identifies non-electronically and singularly tagged agricultural plots and assesses the enclosing boundaries
							of the identified plot. Subsequently, an on-board path-planning module autonomously generates GPS-waypoints for traversing the
							identified plot with minimal overlaps and maximal coverage. Our proposed system exhibits an area coverage efficiency of 95.39% ,
							performs pixel-to-GPS coordinate conversion with an accuracy of 90.35%, and has high agricultural potential in applications such
							as surveying crop-health conditions, spraying pesticide/herbicides, and others. The proposed system has massive applications in
							scenarios requiring aerial detection, demarcation, geographical tagging and coverage of an area.</p>

								<p>We propose a method for a single ground

									controller using keypads or joysticks for controls. The

									to accuracies obtained using expensive Kinectbased
									hardware, or processing intensive CNN-based pose
									estimation techniques with 97.5% and 83.3% average
									accuracies, respectively. A fog-based stabilization mechanism
									is additionally employed, which allows for flight-time

									of unbalanced payloads or unbalancing of the mUAV
									due to minor structural damages. This allows the use

									<h2>Opportunistic UAV Networks</h2>

								</header>
								<p><a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/rose.png" style="width:40%;" align="center" alt=""></a></p>
								<p>In this work, we propose a physical approximation
								scheme – Random Opportunistic and Selective Exploration
								(ROSE) – for aerial localization of survivors by using a collaborative
								swarm of IoT-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
								The UAV swarm performs a simultaneous multi-pronged search
								of a given zone by dividing the search region among the swarm
								members. This multi-pronged search strategy speeds-up the
								search, and the division of search areas among the swarm
								members avoids redundant exploration of an already explored
								location. As the communication range of the member UAVs
								is limited, the swarm members communicate opportunistically
								among themselves to share the information of the visited
								sites. We formulate the various probabilities associated with
								opportunistic communication of these aerial IoT nodes and
								simulate the performance of the approximation algorithm based
								on these formulations. Simulation results of the proposed approach
								successfully locate 100% of the ground targets within an
								acceptable time-frame, and out-performs established searching
								schemes such as the truncated Levy walk, frontier-based search,
								and sweep search.</p>

							<p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are coming up as
								a powerful tool in various industrial applications in the context
								of enabling Industrial IoT. The limited power source and flight
								time of UAVs along with the need for skilled UAV operators are
								some of the most daunting challenges to the integration of UAVs
								in industrial applications such as site inspection, workforce monitoring,
								logistics, and others. In this paper, we propose the unique
								paradigm of blockchain-enabled UAV virtualization to provide
								virtual UAV-as-a-service for industrial applications. The proposed
								architecture also aims at providing secure and persistent UAV
								services to the end-users along with a partially decentralized
								blockchain model to ensure security, privacy, service quality, and
								transparency. UAV virtualization allows persistent UAV services,
								globally, without procuring any physical UAVs. The platform
								offers virtual UAV services on a pay per use basis to the enduser.
								The UAV owners and virtual UAV service providers gain
								monetary benefits for their contribution to the UAV services.
								Finally, we discuss the implications of the proposed platform on
								the domains of Industrial IoT and the possible challenges in the
								implementation of this paradigm.</p>
